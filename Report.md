## User Control and freedom.
Give users the ability to undo and redo digital actions.

## Aesthetic and minimalist design
Keep cluttering the page to a minimum. All information non required competes for the users attention and inhibits the users retrival and retention of relevant information. 
Display only necessary components for the current tasks.

## Speak their language.
All interfaces required some level of copywriting. Make sure you use converstaional text not sensational with as little jargon as possible.
Users will appreciate it.

## Use a visial hierarchy
Design the interface required that allows the user to focus on what you want based on size, color and placement. A clear heirarchy goes
a great length to reduce the appearance of complexity.

## One primary action per screen.
Every screen designed should have one main interaction when designed. This makes things easier to learn, easier to use and easier to build and
add on to. Screens that have more than one primary action become confusing quickly.

## Word your messages and labels effectively.
The text you provide on screen is the primary source of information. If the text is worded poorly your UI is perceived as poorly also. 
eg. "You have input the wrong information” or “An account number should be eight digits in length.”

## Align fields effectively
When a screen has more than one field you want to organize fields in a way that's both visually appealing and efficient. The best way usually 
through aligning the left hand side of the fields.

##Group things effectively
Items that are logically connected should be grouped together on the screen to communicate they are connected. Items that have nothing to do
with each other should be separated. You can use white space between collected items to group them or put boxes around them to accomplish this
